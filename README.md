There are 4 main HTML files, representing the 4 sections of the website users can visit. They are: index.html, aboutus.html, features.html, testimonials.html
  
The css files are located in the css folder, images are stored in the images folder, and the javascript files are in the js folder.
The framework used is Skel, which helped generate a lot of the css code for making the webpage responsive to different screen sizes.
